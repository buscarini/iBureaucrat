#Why?

Nobody likes filling out forms. Or making them. iBureaucrat lets you rapidly create forms for you iOS apps - so you 
can get back to the fun stuff ASAP. 

Using tableviews is the defacto way to layout forms for iOS, and they look great. But for every project there's a
lot of boiler-plate code to set up. It ends up being the same old plumbing code over and over. 

There are a few fantastic forms libraries for iOS. This one attempts to be: 

* Simple and fast to set up forms. 
* Easy to customize by defining new types, look-and-feel, etc.
